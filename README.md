# twain_library-csharp_demo
C# demo program using the <a href="https://github.com/dynarithmic/twain_library" target="_blank">DTWAIN Library</a>.

This demo consists of a Visual Studio solution, **FullDemo.sln**.  To build the demo, simply load the solution into Visual Studio (at least VS 2015), and choose **Build -> Build Solution** from the Visual Studio main menu.

Once built, the demo assumes that <a href="https://github.com/dynarithmic/twain_library/tree/master/binaries/32bit" target="_blank">dtwain32u.dll</a> is available (either on the system PATH or in the same directory as the executable) when the demo is run.  

In addition, please remember that the DTWAIN text resources (twaininfo.txt, twainresourcestrings_english.txt) also need to be available (perferably in the same directory as the executable file).

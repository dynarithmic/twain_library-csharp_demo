# twain_library-csharp_demo
C# demo program using the DTWAIN library

This demo consists of a Visual Studio solution, FullDemo.sln.  To build the demo, simply load the solution into Visual Studio (at least VS 2015), and choose **Build -> Build Solution** from the Visual Studio main menu.

Once built, the demo assumes that DTWAIN32U.DLL is available (either on the system PATH or in the same directory as the executable) when the demo is run.
